# Auto Recruit for Elder Scrolls Online<br><span style="font-size: 66%">(SirNightstorm's Edits)</span>

This repository tracks development of [peniku8's **Auto Recruit** ESO Add-on](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2571-AutoRecruit.html), with updates to add new functionality. You'll find the latest work in the `dev` branch

## Original Description

Recruiting was never easier - Auto Recruit is the perfect tool for guildmasters, officers and dedicated recruiters:
The addon can paste recruitment ads via hotkeys, automatically invite players to your guild of choice when they whisper you a certain keyword, post smart welcome messages automatically teleport and post ads to all major zones and more!


### AutoRecruit's Features:

#### Main functions:

- Automatically invite players to a guild on recieved whispers
- Save a recruitment message for every guild you're in and
- Keybind-post recruitment messages to the zone chat
- (The auto-invite switches to that guild automatically)
- Automatically or semi-automatically port through all major zones and post ads there
- Automatically post welcome messages (only when the new member is online) and also
- Removes the welcome message from your text field, if somebody else already posted it
- Configurable welcome message cooldown, to prevent spamming
- Context-menu entries to invite players to a guild from chat

#### Chat notifications:

- Somebody has been invited to or joined your guild
- Free spots of your guild after somebody joined
- Warning when your guild has less than a set amount of free spots left
- The guild you are recruiting for does not have a guild trader
- Alerts you if you already posted the ad into the zone you are in within a certain time frame (customizable; never accidentally spam again!)
- Chat alerts for all guilds configurable

#### Auto Port:

- Ports through all major zones you have access to on the push of a button
- Ports are free (porting to guild members)
- Automatically advance to the next zone upon arrival or
- wait for you to post the ad to the zone chat and then ports to the next zone
- Can skip zones that are on cooldown

#### Dependencies:

- LibAddonMenu-2.0
- LibCustomMenu

## Changes in this repository

- Will now port to a player house if no guild members or friends are available in a zone
- Added a Setting to choose between porting to major zones and all overland zones
- Added a Setting to store the 'last ported' time for each zone in Saved Preferences, so that it survives a `/reloadui` or a game restart.
